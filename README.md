Hello, I'm D'Harhan, avid No Man's Sky player and teacher, as far as I'm aware, I can say 
with the utmost confidence that if there are players who have a greater amount of knowledge 
on the in-game mechanics, techniques, glitches  and exploits, they can be counted on 1 hand, even if said hand 
lacked a full set of 5 digits. I'm not sure whether this account will actually get much use,
I am seeking avenues to provide documentation/guides/tutorials, some of them for material posted by
other members. I will of course obtain consent prior to posting any supplemental information
on the work of others here.
